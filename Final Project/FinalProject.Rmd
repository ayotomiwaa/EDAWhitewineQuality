## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Loading and inspecting my data set
Background

This tidy data set contains 4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
Our Guiding Question
Which chemical properties influence the quality of white wines?

```{r}
#our data is saved into a variable called wwq

wwq <- read.csv('wineQualityWhites.csv')

names(wwq)

str(wwq)

# there are 4898 observations made in our dataset and there are 13
#variables. Variable x and quality are an integer number.
#Plotting our graph

library(ggplot2)

qplot( X, data = wwq)
qplot(pH, data = wwq)

qplot(log10(X), data = wwq)

```
Compare the pH and the quality of the wine. 
Does the pH affect the quality of wine? The wine with the highest
quality has a value of 9, lowest quality has a value of 3

```{r}
summary(wwq$pH)
#summarize 
summary(wwq$quality)

summary(wwq$alcohol)
```
Next steps:
Investigate and plot histogram of quality
```{r}
#here from the plot we see outliers at 3 and 9
qplot(quality, data = wwq,
      xlim = c(3,9))

qplot(alcohol, data = wwq, binwidth = 1) #+
  #scale_x_continuous(breaks = 8,16)
```
Add a facet 

```{r}
qplot(alcohol, data = wwq, binwidth = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~quality)
```
